Hi,

This is a Dynamic Angular App. Which shows details about a country. 

Here is the general desired working of the app :

1. The countries are categorised on the basis of region. 
2. Whenever a user clicks on particular region he can view all countries in that region.
3. The user can also select a particular country and can view details of that particular country.
4. Further by clicking Currency or Language view the user can view countries with the same Currency  or Language.
5. The user can click world map icon on top left to navigate to home page.
